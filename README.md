PROJECT OVERVIEW This project foucuses on data cleaining and feature engineering using titanic dataset. The goal is to handle missing values,remove inconsistencies and create meaningful new features that improve model performance and understanding

OBJECTIVES Load and explore the titanic dataset Handle missing values effectively Remove duplicate or irrelevant records Correct inconsistent data types and formats Enginner new features to enchance prediction accuracy Prepare the dataset for future machine learining tasks

STEPS INVOLVED 1.DATA LOADING 2.DATA CLEANING 3.FEATURE ENGINEERING

TECHNOLOGIES USED Programming Language: Python Libraries:pandas,NumPy,Mathplotlib,Seaborn,Scikit-learn Environment:Google colab

Results After performing data cleaning and feature engineering:

Missing values were successfully handled.

Dataset became consistent and machine-learning ready.

New features improved interpretability for predictive modeling.
